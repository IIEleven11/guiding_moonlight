[Project Name(Guiding Moonlight)]

[Project goal(Create an application that helps the end user finish their goals.)]

[Application concepts/thought process(
a windows desktop app that tells you what to do everyday. Think of a todo app but instead of you having to fill out everything. You just tell it what you want to accomplish then it makes sure you accomplish at least one thing a day towards that goal. But the idea is you dont have to tell it what those things will be it just understands the goal using AI and what you need to get it done.)]

[End user experience(
1. User inputs a goal they want to accomplish (e.g., learn web development, get fit, write a book).
2. The application uses AI to break down the goal into manageable daily tasks.
3. Goals may take longer than a day to accomplish, so the app will create a schedule of tasks to be completed over time.
4. Each day, the user receives a notification with their task for the day.
5. The user marks the task as complete once done, and the app tracks progress towards the overall goal.
6. The app should be somewhat "pushy". It should remind the user to complete their tasks and encourage them to stay on track.)]

[Technical details(
1. Application needs to be a windows desktop application.
2. Application should have an easy to use UI.
3. Application targets end users not developers.
4. Allow for OPENAI API key to be used for AI task generation and OpenAI Like API calls for local models.
5. Application should store user data locally on the user's machine.
6. Application should be built using a framework suitable for desktop applications (e.g., Electron, .NET, etc.).
7. Application should use windows notification system for daily task reminders.)]

[Application UI style(
1. Clean and minimalistic design to keep the focus on tasks.
2. Dark/almost black background
3. No rounded corners, sharp edges only.
4. No fancy hype words, keep it simple and straightforward.)]
